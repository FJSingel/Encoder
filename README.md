Updating my Segmentator project

Current TODO list:

    Use STDIO instead of reading/writing files
    Use OS.flush after os.remove in a setup
    Add decorators to tearDown
    Mock to replace STDOut for testing
        Learn what things are worth mocking
        Learn how to mock things correctly
    Add verbosity to comments for test cases
    One Line docstrings are *sometimes* ok.
    Change class vs suites to reduce repitition
    Accidently left unused Mock import that was leftover from a removed disfunctional mock-test
