Updating my Segmentator project

Current TODO list:

    Don't name things 'input'
    Create a makefile
    read 1 character at a time instead of using my old (shoddy) segmentator (which has a McCabe complexity of 5 instead of <5)
    Look into stringIO
    Use String.Punctuation as delimiters
    check empty input
    Write to stdio instead of to a file (makes testing easier) and maybe use a wrapper to print
    in lookup(), be more typesafe
    namedtuple in collections might be useful
    Get clarification of requirements for ANY QUESTIONS
        Like Writing from pseudocode vs reusing segmentator if they don't agree
        What form output should be in, like file output vs STDIO
